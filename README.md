# Robotic-Arm-Using-Matlab
This robotic arm has 2 joints is designed to be controlled seamlessly using MATLAB. By simply inputting a desired angle, the arm precisely moves to that position, ensuring accurate and efficient operation. Its functionality mirrors the robotic systems commonly used in factories and commercial settings, making it a practical solution for automation and precision tasks.
